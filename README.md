# Python Practice Programs

This repository contains a collection of Python practice programs designed to build and demonstrate programming skills. The programs include a calculator, a What2Wear decision tool, a To-Do List CLI, and an arXiv Database-related paper keywords fetcher. Each program is standalone and serves as a learning exercise in Python.

#### Usage

Each program is standalone and can be run from the command line.

#### Notes

* These programs are designed for educational purposes and may have minimal error handling or features.

* Feel free to extend any program with additional functionality (e.g., saving tasks to a file, integrating a weather API for What2Wear).


ðŸ˜ŠHappy coding!
